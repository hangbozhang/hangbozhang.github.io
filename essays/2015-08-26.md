A smart question will be a type of questions that hasn’t been asked with a meaningful, specific subject header and using a clear, correctly-spell, grammatical language to describe precisely about the question. 
This type of question is smart because first it is not a question that someone already asked before so it will not waste either your time or others’ time. 
Second with the meaningful, specific subject header it can help the viewer know what this question is about, so it can draw the help from those professional in this kind subject. 
Third with the clear, correctly-spell, grammatical language to describe precisely about the question will help people know exactly what your problem is to get the result you want and provide clear direction in how to solve your problem.
Therefore, asking a smart question is helping people to understand your question quickly and clearly then they can give you the best possible solution faster so that it helps yourself.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
