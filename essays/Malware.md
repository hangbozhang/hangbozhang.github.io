<h3>Abstract</h3>
The purpose of this paper is to specifically focus on two types of malware: trojans
and ransomware. To discuss what they are, how it works, method of spread, possible
damage caused by them, common types of them and some famous examples, and
also to show the ways to detect, prevent and recover from them.


<h3>Introduction</h3>
Malware (a portmanteau for malicious software) is any software intentionally
designed to cause disruption to a computer, server, client, or computer network, leak
private information, gain unauthorized access to information or systems, deprive
users access to information or which unknowingly interferes with the user's computer
security and privacy. By contrast, software that causes harm due to some deficiency
is typically described as a software bug. Malware poses serious problems to
individuals and businesses on the Internet. According to Symantecâ€™s 2018 Internet
Security Threat Report (ISTR), malware variants number has increased to
669,947,865 in 2017, which is twice as many malware variants as in 2016.
Cybercrime, which includes malware attacks as well as other crimes committed by
computer, was predicted to cost the world economy 6 trillion dollars in 2021, and is
increasing at a rate of 15% per year

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
As we can conclude from the two types of malware above: the most common
way of spreading malware is social engineering, the most common damage
caused by the malware is financial lost (either the direct lost as ransom or
indirect lost as the cost to recover the system), the most easy and common
ways to detect and prevent the attack are to install a good anti-malware
software and self-awareness (not click or download suspicious link or
software). And also having a good backup routine can help reduce the
damage of the attack and cost of recovery.
